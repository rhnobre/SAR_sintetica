# Introduction
The code in this folder is a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) simulator. It was written for the paper "Insights sobre simulações de imagem SAR modeladas pela GA0" of journal "IEEE Latin American Transactions" and serves for the purpose of simulating SAR images modeled by GA0.

It is available a set of functions for generation of synthetic SAR images using R or Matlab software.

As discussed in the article, these functions provide the generation of synthetic SAR images using the method of direct and indirect generation, being the indirect method 10x faster than direct.

The codes in Matlab also bring an adjustment in generation by the method indirect , avoiding the problem discussed in the paper.
